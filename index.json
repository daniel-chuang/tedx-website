[{"categories":["Executive Team","Treasurer"],"contents":"Hi my name is Alex, I joined Avenues in 2018 as a freshmen. Since I’ve become a member of the Avenues community I have been focused on how to strengthen student voices and create outlets for students to share their stories and passions. I founded the Jewish Culture Club and became president of the Committee for Social Change in order to contribute to this goal.\nI joined this team, because TEDx creates another avenue for student to share their stories and passions in a more inclusive and open manor. It would be an amazing experience to help run a TEDx event at our school and bring new opportunities to the students and greater avenues community.\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/alex-l/","tags":null,"title":"Alex Lippe"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"My talk is about the negative affects the American media has had on people living in Iran. The United States’ foreign policy with Iran had been mostly amicable until the hostage crisis in 1979. This event changed not only the US’s relationship with Iran, but also global nuclear proliferation as a whole. Iran became one of the most hated nations in the western world by politicians and civilians alike, in the United States this was largely a result of sensationalism in the news. I try my best to address how this happened, and how all of this has changed the world.\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/speakers/alex-ff/","tags":null,"title":"Alexander Farman-Farmaian"},{"categories":["Executive Team","Design Manager"],"contents":"Hi, I’m Daniel. I’ve been watching TED talks for years now, through classes, with family members, or just by myself. I especially enjoy watching the TED riddles, such as the bridge problem. I’m very excited to contribute back to the TEDx and Avenues community simultaneously!\nI am a core organizer and manager of design on this team. This means that I am responsible for our website, graphics, and all visual related aspects of this event. I will also voice my opinions in executive decisions, as well as the curation of speakers. Finally, I will also be coaching our speakers in oration so that they feel and sound confident during the event.\nYou can find more of my work here: https://sites.google.com/view/daniel-chuang/home\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/daniel-c/","tags":null,"title":"Daniel Chuang"},{"categories":["Event Organizer","Stage Designer"],"contents":"","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/dennis-r/","tags":null,"title":"Dennis R"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"testing\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/speakers/jai-j/","tags":null,"title":"Jai Jhamb"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"Hi everyone, my name is Jonathan Waldorf, and I’m here to talk to you about how we can save lives through science and technology. Last summer I was lucky enough to work in a lab where researchers were tracking tornadoes using infrasound, which is below the range of human hearing. When multiple electronic sensors hear infrasound, we can triangulate to find the location of the tornado. With advances in the field, we’ll be able to predict the path of tornados and broadcast a much earlier warning to people in danger. We’ll be able to save lives with faster, cheaper, and better-analyzed mobile data.\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/speakers/jonathan-w/","tags":null,"title":"Jonathan Waldorf"},{"categories":["Executive Team","Founder"],"contents":"Hey! I’m Robert.\nAs a Senior in highschool, the most important lesson I’ve learned is the value of helping others. I’m always looking to support the people around me, because their smiles matter more than any achievements I could possibly hold.\nThat’s why I decided to dedicate myself to this TEDxAvenuesWorldSchool project as the Team Leader, Event Manager and Executive Team Member. My job, in my perspective, is to dedicate my time to those around me to be the best they can, whatever that may be.\n","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/robert-l/","tags":null,"title":"Robert L"},{"categories":["Production Team"],"contents":"","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/samuel-c/","tags":null,"title":"Samuel Centurion"},{"categories":["Production Team"],"contents":"","permalink":"https://daniel-chuang.github.io/tedx-website/team/sofia-d/","tags":null,"title":"Sofia DeJesus"}]
