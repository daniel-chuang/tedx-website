[{"categories":["Executive Team","Treasurer"],"contents":"Hi my name is Alex, I joined Avenues in 2018 as a freshmen. Since I’ve become a member of the Avenues community I have been focused on how to strengthen student voices and create outlets for students to share their stories and passions. I founded the Jewish Culture Club and became president of the Committee for Social Change in order to contribute to this goal.\nI joined this team, because TEDx creates another avenue for student to share their stories and passions in a more inclusive and open manor. It would be an amazing experience to help run a TEDx event at our school and bring new opportunities to the students and greater avenues community.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/team/alex-l/","tags":null,"title":"Alex Lippe"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"My talk is about the negative affects the American media has had on people living in Iran. The United States’ foreign policy with Iran had been mostly amicable until the hostage crisis in 1979. This event changed not only the US’s relationship with Iran, but also global nuclear proliferation as a whole. Iran became one of the most hated nations in the western world by politicians and civilians alike, in the United States this was largely a result of sensationalism in the news. I try my best to address how this happened, and how all of this has changed the world.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/alex-ff/","tags":null,"title":"Alexander Farman-Farmaian"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"My name is Caia Scarola and I am a freshman at Avenues. In my Tedx talk I will ask you to consider some of Apple iPhone’s exclusive features, and the effect they have on teenagers. Apple creates programs that only function between those in the “Apple Ecosystem.” Is this the perfect marketing strategy to enhance profitability and to create exclusivity? Or does it create an insidious and destructive moat between those who have an iPhone and those who don’t? By looking at these examples, I hope to instill a sense of diligence, so that, in the future, you consider the smaller details that you may not have thought about before.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/caia-s/","tags":null,"title":"Caia Scarola"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"Having grown up in the south of Mexico (where it never snows), I’ve had the opportunity to observe the way in which gender roles affect relationships between men and women and the disadvantage the latter have in their economic independence.\nMy TED Talk seeks to bring awareness to the gender disparity that exists when it comes to learning about money, and offers to find solutions that can help nudge society to a more financially balanced world.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/catherine-m/","tags":null,"title":"Catherine Marie Mellett Felix"},{"categories":["Executive Team","Design Manager"],"contents":"Hi, I’m Daniel. I’ve been watching TED talks for years now, through classes, with family members, or just by myself. I especially enjoy watching the TED riddles, such as the bridge problem.

This means that I am responsible for our website, graphics, and all visual related aspects of this event. I will also voice my opinions in executive decisions, as well as the curation of speakers.

In this speech, I will be exploring the origin of the imaginative trait that makes humans so remarkable: how we got from ant munching and leaf eating apes to complex, communicative, and intelligent humans. I hope to offer a new perspective on what it means to be human, and on how we should consider the enormous global issues, such as climate change, that face our species.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/ingrid-b/","tags":null,"title":"Ingrid Berg"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/jai-j/","tags":null,"title":"Jai Jhamb"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"At TEDx Avenues, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about how we can save lives through science and technology. Last summer I was lucky enough to work in a lab where researchers were tracking tornadoes using infrasound, which is below the range of human hearing. When multiple electronic sensors hear infrasound, we can triangulate to find the location, velocity and direction of the tornado. With advances in the field, we’ll be able to detect tornados in real-time, predict their path, and broadcast a much earlier warning to people in danger. We’ll be able to save lives with faster, cheaper, and better-analyzed mobile data.\n","permalink":"https://tedxavenues.org/speakers/jonathan-w/","tags":null,"title":"Jonathan Waldorf"},{"categories":["Speaker"],"contents":"Joseph Weissberg is a senior at Avenues.

If there\u0026rsquo;s anything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned throughout the course of my Avenues experience, it\u0026rsquo;s the importance of art and knowledge in the minds of adolescence. There are so many ways to enrich your own perspective, celebrate talent and rigor, and spark inspiring conversations. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s through watching a thought-provoking film (as I personally love to do), reading about philosophy or science (also another personal favorite), or\u0026hellip; participating in an engaging seminar like\u0026hellip;TEDx Avenues!

On top of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed war, famine, devastating hurricanes, earthquakes, and forest fires! The natural and man-made calamities that many of us have to live through have definitely affected the mental health of many individuals. Hence, a lot of studies are being done on a human trait that, when developed, could help us get through our darkest moments: resilience. In my TEDX talk, I am going to take you to my childhood, as I learn resilience from my mother who speaks a different native language than her children. We will reflect on how Filipinos gained a reputation as the \u0026ldquo;resilient people\u0026rdquo;. We will look at how this resilience is manifested in the language of my childhood, the life of my community, and the role it plays not only in the life of many Filipinos but also in all of us.\nVon Ryan Abrantes is an Upper Division Science teacher at Avenues, New York. He grew up in Valenzuela City, Philippines from parents who moved there from the province of Leyte in the Visayan Region.
