      <description>Hi my name is Alex, I joined Avenues in 2018 as a freshmen. Since I’ve become a member of the Avenues community I have been focused on how to strengthen student voices and create outlets for students to share their stories and passions.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Daniel. I’ve been watching TED talks for years now, through classes, with family members, or just by myself. I especially enjoy watching the TED riddles, such as the bridge problem.</description>

      <description>Hey! I’m Robert.
As a Senior in highschool, the most important lesson I’ve learned is the value of helping others. I’m always looking to support the people around me, because their smiles matter more than any achievements I could possibly hold.</description>
